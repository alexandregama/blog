Hey friends!

This will be really short, I promise. This is the discovery of the day and I want to share it.

Are you immersed in the JavaScript world? Or are you just getting started? 

![image](../../images/post/react-redux-recoil-state-management/javascript-study.png)

In both contexts probably you have heard about **React.** Old like me? Probably **React.js**

## React

Just a terrible overview:

- React is a JavaScript library
- React allows us to build rich user interfaces
- React allows us to build single-page applications
- React allows us to build mobile applications
- React is based on components

One interesting point is that **React allows us to manipulate/render data**. This is a more **Stateless** approach, which means that **React has a short memory**, on purpose btw.

- Request A renders my name on the page
- Request B completely forgets the rendered name

But usually, life works in mysterious ways and we need to know what happened previously. That's when **State Management** comes handy.

React has friends. React has an important friend. **Redux**

## Redux

If you want to have a good memory, if you want to be aware of the data you're rendering between requests, then you're thinking about **Redux**

My terrible overview again:

- Redux is a JavaScript Library (makes some sense, isn't it?)
- Redux manages the application state
- Follows the reducing function approach (which I'm gonna tell you more about later)

it sounds that React has a new friend for State Management. Welcome **[Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/)** :)

## Recoil

I've just discovered Recoil from [Twitter](https://twitter.com/_alex_gama), as we discover everything in life.

To be honest, I don't know yet how it works but the pitch is great

- You can share state easily
- Functional concepts in its core
- Create subscriptions to listen events asynchronously (my dream is to write this word correctly on the first attempt)
- Amazing granularity with [Atoms](https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/core-concepts#atoms) and [Selectors](https://recoiljs.org/docs/introduction/core-concepts#selectors)

If I have some time, I'll play around with Recoil on my weekend and give you guys a better and detailed description.

Thanks for stopping by and see you tomorrow :)

Let's keep in touch ðŸ™‚
