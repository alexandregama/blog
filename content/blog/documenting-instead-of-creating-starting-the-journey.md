Guilty!

I don't know about you, but when it comes to **personal** stuff, I overthink everything.

I've been waiting for hitting the record button to start youtube videos **for more than 3 years**! Just a quick note: I haven't hit the button yet ¬¬

Today I came across this **Documenting instead of Creating** process and I really loved the idea. Simple and powerful.

The way that Sean McCabe puts it really clicks with me. I've heard about the process before but for some reason **I'm taking action just right now**.

What I desired to do with videos and blog posts? Well, I'd like to share content related to topics that I really love, that I'm learning and that I have no clue on how to get started

- Coding and Technology
- Productivity
- Leadership
- Business
- History
- Lifestyle
- Music

And the list goes on and on

But as a good overthinking person as I am, a have a **full and complete set of questions that makes a good job in keeping me far away** from my goals in sharing content:

- I'm not an English native speaker and I've learned (I'm still learning) English too old. I need to practice for more 5 years to be good enough
- I don't have the right Youtube gear. What about spending the next 3 years on weekends studying Youtube gears to be good enough?
- People don't care about what I want to say. Do I have to be creative to get attention?
- It's a crowded world with amazing content. Why should I bother the world with what I'm thinking?
- This is wrong. It doesn't have good quality. I'll start it over again
- I have to find the perfect font for this blog
- What's worth sharing?
- No one wants to see this

And the list goes on and one again

And you find yourself stuck with a list of things that you can't even see how to get started. 

And when you start looking for some answers about overthinking, a few interesting answers come up

Ok Google, that's enough for today

I don't know about you, but when it comes to **professional** life, things are really different. For some bizarre reason!

> I'm super pragmatic, energetic, and I want to get things done as soon as possible with all of the imperfections because it's amazing to adjust things along the way. It's a beautiful and remarkable process. It really is.

So, today is a really important day for me :)

**I'll start embracing** this terrible and uncomfortable zone of sharing content without overthinking things. 

**I'll start documenting the journey instead of overthinking about the content.**

I'm going to face a lot of problems, imperfections, issues, people laughing at my grammar and pronunciation mistakes and to be honest, for some reason (maybe I'm getting too old to care about), I'm totally ok with that

I'm going to capture this journey, the issues, the process I'm using to surround those issues and then, who knows, I'll look at this in 10 years and I'll be happy to just have started

Stay tuned if you want to see where it goes :)
