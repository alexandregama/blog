Hey!

As I've documented [here](https://www.alexgama.io/blog/documenting-instead-of-creating-starting-the-journey/) **I'm documenting my journey in creating content**, mostly related to Coding, Architecture, Frameworks but also related to Leadership, Startups, and Product Management, which are topics that I really love and learning a lot.

This will be a **short intro to my blog set up**. In the upcoming posts, I'll describe other options and the "whys" behind the scenes

### Static Site Generators (SSG) versus Content Management Systems (CMS)

That was the first decision. Which one should I use?

I wanted:

- A blazing fast blog
- Amazing Markdown support
- The possibility of avoiding databases usage
- Just worry about writing content

The requirements matched with **Static Site Generators**. Simple.

Don't get me wrong again, CMSs are amazing also. We can even work with cache, JavaScript, etc to have a faster website, but this is a story for another post

### Hugo vs Jekyll vs Gatsby vs Next

All of them are amazing! Really!

I picked **Hugo.

- Fast
- Simple
- Written in Go (I personally love)
- Really fast compilation
- Flexibility with Shortcodes and Markdown
- Good themes

Again. Don't get me wrong. Most of them have the same characteristics. Sometimes it's just a personal choice, but I'll dissect my choices later

### Hosting and Deployment

Hugo provides us a beautiful list of places where you can host your site. Hugo renders static pages so you can probably host it anywhere

Here is a small list:

- AWS Amplify
- Firebase
- AWS S3
- GitLab
- Github Pages
- Netlify

I picked **Github Pages**

- It's free
- It's easy
- You can commit your posts
- It supports custom domains

Terribly short. I know. I just wanted to give you a taste of how my blog setup looks like

Next posts I'll explore a few important points:

- My personal comparison between Hugo and Jekyll
- How to set up an entire blog from scratch using Hugo, GitHub Pages and Godaddy
- How to choose a specific Hugo Theme
- How to write your first posts

That's it for today! Thanks for stopping by :)
