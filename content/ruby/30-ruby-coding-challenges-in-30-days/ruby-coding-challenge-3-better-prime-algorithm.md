Hey!

Day 3 of 30: Ruby Coding Challenge number 3.

This is the post version of[] this video on Youtube]()

[In the previous video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT6aoeOsEwY) we solved a really common challenge:

> How many prime items are in a given array

The final code was terrible. However, I'm not even sorry. Remembering why:

- How does my brain work when it comes to solving algorithms? Just get the job done! Decorate after that.

When it comes to algorithms, decoration means a few things:

- Better performance
- Better readability
- Better maintainability

Well, better code design

Today I'll solve the same problem with (I hope) a better code design:

Below you can see the first ugly version:

## #1 - Ugly Algorithm Version

```ruby
def count_prime_number_version_1(array)
  prime_count = 0
  for item in array
    next if item == 1
    is_prime = true

    number = item - 1
    while number > 1
      if item % number == 0
        is_prime = false
        break
      else
        number = number - 1
      end
    end

    if is_prime
      prime_count = prime_count + 1
    end
  end
  return prime_count
end

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
puts count_prime_number_version_1(array)
```

It's time to organize the kitchen. It would be great to have a method that verifies if a given number is prime.

## #2 - Method Organization

We have 2 main responsibilities

- iterate over the array, asking questions
- validate if a given number is prime or not

I'm going to split this into 2 methods, which will have those responsibilities above:

```ruby
def count_prime_number_version_2(array)
  count_prime = 0
  for item in array
    if is_prime(item) # the new method. it's better. It's clearer
      count_prime = count_prime + 1
    end
  end
  return count_prime
end

def is_prime(item)
  return false if item == 1

  count = item - 1
  while count > 1
    if item % count == 0
      return false
    end
    count = count - 1
  end
  return true
end
```

Cool. It's time to bring some Ruby power and use Ruby Blocks with the count method, which we [did in in the first video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o95D7as27Q)

```ruby
def count_prime_number_version_2(array)
  array.count do |item|
    is_prime_number(item)
  end
end
```

## #3 - Ruby Arrays

II don't know about you, but I hate local variables. 

It's time to get rid of them. In Ruby it's possible to indicate which items should be created in an array, given

- the initial number
- the pattern to generate the next number

```ruby
def is_prime_number(item)
  return false if item == 1

  (2..(item - 1)).each do |number|
    if item % number == 0
      return false
    end
  end
  return true
end
```

Amazing, isn't it?

## #4 - Cheating: Ruby Prime Library

Now that we know how to create the Algorithm manually, it usually doesn't make sense in real life

Ruby has a **Prime** Library, which can get the job done easily.

We just ask if the number is prime or not. Notice that we're importing the Prime library

```ruby
require 'Prime'

Prime.prime?(item)
```

Going ahead and replacing the **is_prime(item)** method:

```ruby
def count_prime_version_6(array)
	array.count do |item|
    Prime.prime?(item)
  end
end
```

And that's our final version, a little bit different than the first one üòè

```ruby
def count_prime_final_version(array)
	array.count do |item|
    Prime.prime?(item)
  end
end

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
puts count_prime_final_version(array)
```

That's it. I hope that you've learned 1 thing or 2 : )

{{< youtube Y3W64fXmfkw >}}

Thinking out loud here, probably the next coding challenge will be rewriting the Algorithm manually using Recursion üòè

Thanks for your visit, let's keep in touch and see you!
