Hey friends!

This is the blog post version of the [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/9-lbnrgD7-8) from the [30 Ruby Coding Challenges in 30 Days series](https://courses.alexgama.io/course?courseid=ruby-coding-challenges-course)

Today we want to solve the previous puzzle using a more Ruby/Decent way to solve problems. Let's get into it!

## Previous Algorithm Version

The previous algorithm version looks like this:

```ruby
def find_missing_num(array)
  (1..10).each do |item|
    found = false
    array.each do |number|
      if item == number
        found = true
        break
      end      
    end
    if found = false
      return item
    end
  end
end

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
find_missing_num(array)
```

## New Algorithm Version

It's time to avoid manipulating the array manually. We can easily do that by using the method **include?()** on the array

```ruby
arr.include?(number)
```

The simple and complete code could be:

```ruby
def missing_num(arr)
  (1..10).each do |num|
    return num unless arr.include?(num)
  end
end

array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]
missing_num(array)
```

Pretty simple, isn't it? ðŸ˜Ž
