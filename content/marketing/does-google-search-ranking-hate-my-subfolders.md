Hey!

Running out of time? Short answer: **No**. I wouldn't worry about that at all

#### More curious?

How does a subfolder look like?

You might have this

[https://www.alexgama.io/personal/i-am-a-very-slow-thinker/](https://www.alexgama.io/personal/i-am-a-very-slow-thinker/)

Or you might have this

[https://www.alexgama.io/reviews/podcast/podcast-review-1-how-to-create-content-daily/](https://www.alexgama.io/reviews/podcast/podcast-review-1-how-to-create-content-daily/)

Both are using subfolders, which almost represent a category in my case:

/personal/

/reviews/podcast/

/reviews/books/

#### Does Google differentiate URLs with less or more subfolders?

According to Google, Noup. Google doesn't give a higher ranking based on the number of subfolders.

Google looks at the way you structure your site and Google loves to see a good connection between your URLs
and how easy it is to navigate between them.

#### What about the usability?

In my opinion, it seems nicer to just share a simpler URL, like this:

[https://www.alexgama.io/i-am-a-very-slow-thinker/](https://www.alexgama.io/i-am-a-very-slow-thinker/)

- It's easier to read
- It's easier to share
- It's easier to remember and pay attention

Compared with

So, why don't you just use the second one? ðŸ˜’

**2 Reasons**

**Reason 1** - It's more maintainable when it comes to writing new posts and editing old ones.

I'm using [Hugo with GitHub btw](https://www.alexgama.io/frontend/my-blog-setup-long-story-short-going-through-hugo-github-pages/)

![image](../../../images/post/marketing/alex-gama-blog-structure-hugo-seo-post.png)

But with Hugo I can easily indicate **aliases**, which allows me to use the simpler URL

```
aliases:
  - /personal/i-am-a-very-slow-thinker/
  - /blog/i-am-a-very-slow-thinker/
  - /i-am-a-very-slow-thinker/
```

**Reason 2** - It works like a wrapper of posts, for that category

[https://www.alexgama.io/personal/](https://www.alexgama.io/personal/)

The URL above shows all of the posts under that subfolder. Nice!

That's all for today and thanks for the visit!
